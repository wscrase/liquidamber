          <h3>Tree Owner Responsibilities</h3>
          <i class="fas fa-tree"></i>
          <p>Owners of trees have a “Duty of Care” under the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and 1984. This
            states that they must take “Such care as is reasonable” to ensure that no harm comes to people
            or property as a result of foreseeable incidents involving trees on their property.
            The best way to ensure this is upheld is to have regular inspections of your tree/trees from a
            suitably qualified professional.</p>

        <div class="consultancy-type">
          <h3>Planning Applications</h3>
          <i class="fas fa-clipboard-list""></i>
          <p>Often planning applications will require a tree survey. Work to trees in conservation areas and tree
            with Tree Preservation Orders will require planning permission to undertake tree surgery work on
            them.
            Building work intended near trees will often require an arboricultural report outlining how damage
            to the trees can be mitigated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="consultancy-type">
          <h3>Health and Condition Surveys.</h3>
          <i class="fas fa-stethoscope"></i>
          <p>This is a baseline inspection of the trees overall health and condition. It is undertaken from ground
            level and will look into the overall apparent health of the tree as well as any structural defects that
            may be present. This could be: Cracks, Broken Limbs, Large Diameter Deadwood, Cavities,
            presence of Fungal Fruiting Bodies and signs of decay.
            Data will be collected and then a report will be written which will also contain any work
            recommendations that may be necessary to mitigate risk.

        <div class="consultancy-type">
          <h3>Aerial Tree Inspections</h3>
          <i class="fas fa-search"></i>
          <p>Sometimes it will be necessary to assess noted features from the crown of the tree, will this will
            required tree climbing or access with mechanical lifts to make an accurate assessment of tree
            safety.</p>

          <h3>Internal Decay Detection</h3>
          <i class="fas fa-flask"></i>
          <p>Sometimes its not possible to assess the extent of decay visually and further investigation may be
            required. This can be performed with more specialist equipment such as Resistograph and Sonic
            Tomograph machines.</p>
