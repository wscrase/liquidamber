            <h2>Tree Removal & Felling</h2>
            <p>Whether you need to remove a tree due to disease, storm damage, or safety concerns, our professional tree felling services ensure safe and efficient removal. We specialise in controlled dismantling, particularly for trees in tight spaces or near buildings, using advanced rigging techniques to prevent damage.</p>
            <p>Our expert arborists assess each tree carefully, ensuring compliance with local tree preservation regulations before removal. If you're unsure whether a tree needs felling or pruning, we provide consultations to help you make the right decision.</p>

            <h2>Crown Reductions & Thinning</h2>
            <p>A crown reduction is a precise pruning technique used to reduce the overall size of a tree while maintaining its natural shape. By carefully shortening each branch, we can improve light penetration, reduce wind resistance, and enhance the tree’s health and longevity.</p>
            <p>This service is ideal for trees that have become too large for their surroundings or pose a risk due to excessive weight. Our team ensures all cuts are made to appropriate growth points, promoting healthy regrowth while preserving the tree's structure.</p>

            <h2>Deadwood Removal</h2>
            <p>Over time, trees naturally develop dead branches, which can pose a significant risk if left unchecked. Our deadwood removal service eliminates hazardous branches, reducing the risk of falling limbs that could endanger property, pedestrians, or vehicles.</p>
            <p>Regular deadwood removal is essential for maintaining tree health and ensuring safety in residential gardens, public parks, and commercial landscapes. Our expert arborists inspect each tree thoroughly, identifying and removing any unstable limbs.</p>
